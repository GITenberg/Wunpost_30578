description: Wunpost was the nickname bestowed on John C. Calhoun, who discovered
  one gold mine after another, only to be cheated out of them by the ruthless Judson
  Eells. Eells used hired killers and fine-print contracts drawn up by a low-down
  lawyer to tie up honest prospectors and take the gold for himself. John C. Calhoun
  wasn't book smart, but he wasn't going to be taken for a fool. He'd get even with
  those thieves and thugs--and they'd never see it coming.
